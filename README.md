# Chess-Game

**Chess-Game** is a Python implementation of a chess game featuring intelligent move predictions and basic strategic optimisation. Built as a learning-centred portfolio project, this repository showcases core principles of game logic, decision making and clean code structure within a classic board game context.

The project focuses on:
- A Python-native representation of chess mechanics (moves, rules, game state)
- Algorithms that support intelligent or strategic play
- Clear modular design emphasising readability and extensibility

This project is not intended as a full production-level chess engine, but rather as a demonstration of structured game logic and simple AI patterns suitable for learners, reviewers and developers exploring Python game development.
